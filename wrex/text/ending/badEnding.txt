Now that the world was rid of these trapped souls, especially that weird one 
that resembled you,  you can focus on searching for a way out. Perhaps there 
was a way out in the place with all those floating torches. As you turn there 
a hand from the ground graps your leg. It belonged to the shadowy versionn of
yourself. The another hand, from the soldier. Suddenly the ghost dog bites 
your leg and the dragon sinks its fangs into you. You find yourself overcome
with the guilt of failing what your true purpose is. 

...You lose!
