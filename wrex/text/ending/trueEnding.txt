As your shadow dissipates you hear the voice, "Thank you..." What a long night
this has been, you think to yourself. You notice the torch that you had used 
on the ground. You picked it up and the torch lights up again. You use the 
torch to light your path and begin to walk. While walking, you suddenly 
realize you are back in the forest. You find where you were resting before and
lay down to sleep. Tomorrow another adventure awaits!
