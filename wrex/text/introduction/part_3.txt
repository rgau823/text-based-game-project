As you look around for the voice, you spot a shadowy figure in the distance.
The voice continues,
Trapped in this world are three souls who are cursed to remain here. Their
ties to the world are particularly strong. Without your help they will never
find peace. I ask that you seek out these trapped souls and help them, if you
can. But be warned, this world is dangerous. There are other enemies in this
world and the trapped souls may not even realize they are stuck here and
may refuse your help. You will need to use your abilities to find out if there
is some way to free them. Lastly, know it was not I that trapped you in this
world, but these spirits seeking out your ability that has brought you here.
If you wish to leave, you must free these souls.
